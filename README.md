# Trippin'

This is a simple website for planning and recording reviews of vacations. The user can add a location, then specify if it is somewhere they have visited or somewhere they want to visit. If the location has been visited, they can add a review. If they haven't visited the location, it goes on their bucket list. The website can be viewed at http://sarah-story.github.io/trippin.

This project utilizes [RequireJS](http://requirejs.org/) for module management. It also uses the Google Maps API to get map images for each of the locations.
